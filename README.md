An FTL: Faster Than Light inspired 2D space simulator

## Team composition
- Iacobescu Tudor, 3A6
- Stefanica Catalin, 3A4
- Suruniuc Constantin, 3A3

## Game description
The base idea is something in the same vein as FTL: Faster Than Light. This means ship-to-ship battles, basic crew management, and basic atmospheric simulation. Expand upon this with customizable, expandable ships (room-by-room or on a smaller scale), resource gathering mechanics (asteroid mining) and a wider array of things to be done, shifting the focus from a linear action game to a more freeform one.
