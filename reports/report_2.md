# Week 4 and 5 reports

## Iacobescu Tudor
I've added a proper health bar instead of the previous prototype, which just had a number. Additionally, I've added a score counter that increments when enemies are killed. This could make for a simple gameplay loop where you survive for as long as you can and go for a high score.

I've done a bit of brainstorming, discussing a few ideas and the order they should be implemented with my team members.

I've started working on adding more weapons to the game, starting with:
- a shotgun-like weapon that fires multiple weaker pellets in an arc
- a missile launcher with a longer cooldown that fires slow, strong projectiles that speed up over time
