# Lab 2-3 reports

## Iacobescu Tudor
Over the past two weeks, I have learned a bit about Godot and how to do things in it. This involved, largely, following the Godot guides.

As for the practical side of things, I've done some work into the initial idea for an FTL-inspired space sim, but it turned out that the idea likely too mechanically advanced for our skill levels. We've shelved the FTL idea, and I quickly put together a prototype for a simple Galaga or Chicken Invaders inspired space shooter.

Currently, this new project includes one kind of enemy, travelling simply to the bottom of the screen and firing projectiles. The player controls another ship, which can currently fire one kind of projectile back, and take damage. As of right now, the game keeps going until the player ship dies.

Did some work on the now shelved FTL idea:
- experimented with Godotâ€™s tilemap system
- acquired tilesheets and assets to use in the project
- found necessary tools to adapt the tilesheets to our needs
- started converting the tilesheets to autotiles, atlases and sprites
- started working on prototype, with one ship firing at another in another viewport
