# Lab 2-3 reports

## Iacobescu Tudor
Over the past two weeks, I have learned a bit about Godot and how to do things in it. This involved, largely, following the Godot guides.

As for the practical side of things, I've added some placeholder art assets, and used them to make a couple of basic "ships", with some weapons. One of them is the player ship, the other is the enemy. I've also started working on a prototype for the weapon system.

Right now, all I've got is: projectiles spawn randomly at the edge of the enemy panel, travelling towards the target and disappearing when they reach it. Some problems right now include the fact that the target of the projectiles is offset (so one has to click way outside the enemy panel to fire at the enemy), that the projectile rendering is not limited to the enemy panel, and that projectiles disappear regardless of whether the target was over the enemy or somewhere else in the enemy panel. The eventual plan is to have projectiles spawn at the weapons on the player ship, travel right to the edge of the screen, disappear, and reappear and keep travelling as they currently do - to simulate the projectile travelling from the player ship to the enemy one.

- acquired tilesheets and assets to use in the project
- found necessary tools to adapt the tilesheets to our needs
