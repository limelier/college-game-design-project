# Week 4 report

## Iacobescu Tudor
I've added a proper health bar instead of the previous prototype, which just had a number. 

Not much else right now, as the prototype itself was delivered a little late. Hope to recover some ground this week, add a few extra gameplay features. Some ideas I have are:
- multiple enemy types
- multiple weapons
- score system that counts enemy kills?

Once the game has these features, maybe release a second prototype for testing on #test-bench.
